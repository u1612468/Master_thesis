# Data Clean
We cleaned data to eliminate invalid data, including missing or irrelevant entries and duplicate records. This process resulted in a dataset of 174,016 job postings.

After running the above two ipynb files, we could get the clean data for each industry, which are stored in Finance_cleaned_file.csv and Internet_cleaned_file.csv, which is compressed in Cleaned_file.zip.

Note that Internet_all.csv and Finance_all.csv are stored in Data.zip in the crawl_data folder, before running ipynb files, don't forget to download them.
