# The Analysis of Recruitment Criteria in China's Internet and Finance Industries

# Abstract

This study investigates recruitment criteria in the Internet and finance industries across key Chinese cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. Utilizing a web crawl technique to get online recruitment platform data (\url{https://www.zhaopin.com/}), we examined 174,016 job postings and administered a questionnaire to explore recruitment discrimination.  Using Chinese word segmentation and relevant techniques to analyze job posting data, our findings reveal variations in job opportunities, educational preferences, salaries, and essential skills between the Internet and finance sectors in key Chinese cities. Recruitment discrimination rates fluctuate across cities, with Shenzhen reporting elevated rates. Education discrimination prevails, accompanied by age and gender discrimination. Notably, female individuals are more likely to perceive gender discrimination.
