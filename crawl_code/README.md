# Here, all the Python files for web crawling using the Scrapy framework are stored

If required, you can download zlzp.zip to get all the Python files.
Note here, run the **main.py** to start crawling data, and your Chrome will automatically open **zhilian** website; you need to **log in** to get access to crawl more pages. Otherwise, a guest only can see the first page. All Python packages are listed in **requirements.txt**. Remember to download your chrome version **web driver**.
